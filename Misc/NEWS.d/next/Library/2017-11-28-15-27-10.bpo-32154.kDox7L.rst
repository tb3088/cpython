The ``asyncio.windows_utils.socketpair()`` function has been removed: use
directly :func:`socket.socketpair` which is available on all platforms since
Python 3.5 (before, it wasn't available on Windows).
``asyncio.windows_utils.socketpair()`` was just an alias to
``socket.socketpair`` on Python 3.5 and newer.
