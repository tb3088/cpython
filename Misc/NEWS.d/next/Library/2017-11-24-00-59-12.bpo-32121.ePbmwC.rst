Made ``tracemalloc.Traceback`` behave more like the traceback module, 
sorting the frames from oldest to most recent. ``Traceback.format()`` 
now accepts negative *limit*, truncating the result to the ``abs(limit)`` 
oldest frames. To get the old behaviour, one can use the new 
*most_recent_first* argument to ``Traceback.format()``.
