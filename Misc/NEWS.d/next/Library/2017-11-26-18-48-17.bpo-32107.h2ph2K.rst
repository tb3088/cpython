``uuid.getnode()`` now preferentially returns universally administered MAC
addresses if available, over locally administered MAC addresses.  This makes a
better guarantee for global uniqueness of UUIDs returned from
``uuid.uuid1()``.  If only locally administered MAC addresses are available,
the first such one found is returned.
