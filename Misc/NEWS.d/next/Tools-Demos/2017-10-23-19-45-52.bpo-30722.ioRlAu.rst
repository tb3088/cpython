Make redemo work with Python 3.6 and newer versions.

In Python 3.6, flags like re.DOTALL became members of an enum.IntFlag so
usages like ``getattr(re, 'DOTALL')`` are invalid.

Also, remove the ``LOCALE`` option since it doesn't work with string
patterns in Python 3.

Patch by Christoph Sarnowski.
