Improve tk event exception tracebacks in IDLE.
When tk event handling is driven by IDLE's run loop, a confusing
and distracting queue.EMPTY traceback context is no longer added
to tk event exception tracebacks.  The traceback is now the same
as when event handling is driven by user code.  Patch based on a
suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.
