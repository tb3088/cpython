Use non-Latin characters in the IDLE's Font settings sample.

Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode

Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a

character.  The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters

a better idea of what they might see in IDLE's shell and editors.



To make room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are

re-arranged.  The Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.
